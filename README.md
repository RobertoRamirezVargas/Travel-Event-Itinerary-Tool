# Travel And Event Itinerary Tool
As the Final Project from my Bootcamp I presented a Travel and Event itinerary tool website.
This is the beta version of it. Meaning Im still working on it.

A tool designed to enhance experiences in the userâ€™s Canadian city. With this tool, the user can effortlessly explore nearby events and restaurants, enabling them to curate a personalized itinerary that suits user preferences. Additionally, our tool provides users with weather information and an interactive Google maps feature.
Technologies used: REACT.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
